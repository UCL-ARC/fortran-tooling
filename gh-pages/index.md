# Fortran Tooling

Welcome to Fortran tooling documentation

## Motivation

- Our motivations for this project
    - We work on large legacy projects which do not utilise software tool (testing, docs, etc).
    - We want to increase adoption of these tools and make it easier to do so.
        - We believe this will make it easier for new joiners to start working on a legacy Fortran project
    - We want to help choose which tools are appropriate (do not need to throw out existing tools if they are already well established)
    - Up-skill Fortran developers on available tools and how to follow best practices.
        - This will be done in the form of a course developed by ourselves
- What we will do to achieve this
    - Provide guidance on how to work on legacy fortran projects
        - Which tools to choose from and how to use them
        - Why you would choose between tool a and tool b
        - Provide working examples of the tools we recommend
- How we have provided examples (Current README.md)
    - Description of src code (how to run, build, test, build docs, etc)
    - Navigating subfolders
