# [fortls](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fortls)

The Fortran language server enables easy local development through a range of features including,

- Auto-completion
- Hover signature help
- Go to / peek implementation

## Integration with IDEs

### VSCode

fortls is implemented within VSCode via the [Modern Fortran extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/?itemName=fortran-lang.linter-gfortran).

If signature help and go to implementation is not working within VSCode, ensure no other Fortran language extensions are installed in your VSCode environment. These can interfere with each other.
