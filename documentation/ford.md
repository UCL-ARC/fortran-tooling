# [FORD](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford)

FORtran Documenter (FORD) is an automatic documentation generater designed for Fortran.

Originally conveived due to Doxygen's historical lack of Fortran support, FORD has turned into a well established and feature-rich documentation project.
See [the FORD repository](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford) for a full description of the features available.

TODO list some of the useful bits we're interested in here/are unique from Doxygen?

## Installation

Installation (and automatic handling of dependencies) can be done through pip:

```sh
pip install ford
```

Installation is also available through Homebrew with the following commands:

```sh
brew update
brew install FORD
```

There is also a spack pacakge available to install FORD:

```sh
spack install py-ford
```

## Use

I would like to have some examples here, which could be in a sub-directory. 
Next Tooling Day, I suppose!
Or if anyone else wants to contribute them...
