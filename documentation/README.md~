# Fortran Documentation

Building documentation from your source code has widely been used for a long time, and now commonly used tools like Doxygen work with Fortran.

## Candidate Tools

| Tool | Description | Known issues |
| **Recommended** | | |
| [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) | Commonly used documentation tool for large repositories. Officially supports Fortran with language-specific docblocks | <ul><li> Examples are somewhat outdated </li><li> Support traditionally has not been great </li></ul> |
| [FORD](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford) | Created due to Doxygen's lack of Fortran compatability, FORtran Documentater (FORD) is an independent automatic documenter for modern Fortran | <ul><li> Not the healthiest repository </li><li> Not as feature rich as Doxygen (in principle) </ul> |
| **Other options** | | |
| 
| **Dead projects** | | |
| [ROBODoc](https://rfsber.home.xs4all.nl/Robo/) | Automatic parsing of any comment-enabled language into various output formats | <ul><li>Last updated 2021</li><li> Various links no longer work </li></ul> |
| [Doctran](https://github.com/CPardi/Doctran) | Cross-platform documentation generator specifically designed for Fortran | <ul><li> Last updated 9 years ago </li><li> Homepage examples et al no longer exist </li></ul> |
