# Doxyfile 1.15.0

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# Doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").
#
# Note:
#
# Use Doxygen to compare the used configuration file with the template
# configuration file:
# doxygen -x [configFile]
# Use Doxygen to compare the used configuration file with the template
# configuration file without replacing the environment variables or CMake type
# replacement variables:
# doxygen -x_noenv [configFile]

# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------


# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "Fortran Tooling"


# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewers a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          = "Recommendations and examples for Fortran tools used in UCL’s Advanced Research Computing center"


# With the PROJECT_ICON tag one can specify an icon that is included in the tabs
# when the HTML document is shown. Doxygen will copy the logo to the output
# directory.

PROJECT_ICON           = "docs/assets/favicon.ico"

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where Doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = "docs/doxygen-docs"

# Set the OPTIMIZE_FOR_FORTRAN tag to YES if your project consists of Fortran
# sources. Doxygen will then generate output that is tailored for Fortran.
# The default value is: NO.

OPTIMIZE_FOR_FORTRAN   = YES

# The MARKDOWN_ID_STYLE tag can be used to specify the algorithm used to
# generate identifiers for the Markdown headings. Note: Every identifier is
# unique.
# Possible values are: DOXYGEN use a fixed 'autotoc_md' string followed by a
# sequence number starting at 0 and GITHUB use the lower case version of title
# with any whitespace replaced by '-' and punctuation characters removed.
# The default value is: DOXYGEN.
# This tag requires that the tag MARKDOWN_SUPPORT is set to YES.

MARKDOWN_ID_STYLE      = GITHUB

# When the INLINE_GROUPED_CLASSES tag is set to YES, classes, structs and unions
# are shown inside the group in which they are included (e.g. using \ingroup)
# instead of on a separate page (for HTML and Man pages) or section (for LaTeX
# and RTF).
#
# Note that this feature does not work in combination with
# SEPARATE_MEMBER_PAGES.
# The default value is: NO.

INLINE_GROUPED_CLASSES = YES

# When the INLINE_SIMPLE_STRUCTS tag is set to YES, structs, classes, and unions
# with only public data fields or simple typedef fields will be shown inline in
# the documentation of the scope in which they are defined (i.e. file,
# namespace, or group documentation), provided this scope is documented. If set
# to NO, structs, classes, and unions are shown on a separate page (for HTML and
# Man pages) or section (for LaTeX and RTF).
# The default value is: NO.

INLINE_SIMPLE_STRUCTS  = YES

# If the TIMESTAMP tag is set different from NO then each generated page will
# contain the date or date and time when the page was generated. Setting this to
# NO can help when comparing the output of multiple runs.
# Possible values are: YES, NO, DATETIME and DATE.
# The default value is: NO.

TIMESTAMP              = DATETIME

# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES, Doxygen will prepend the full path
# before files name in the file list and in the header files. If set to NO the
# shortest path that makes the file name unique will be used
# The default value is: YES.

FULL_PATH_NAMES = NO


#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Build related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# With the correct setting of option CASE_SENSE_NAMES Doxygen will better be
# able to match the capabilities of the underlying filesystem. In case the
# filesystem is case sensitive (i.e. it supports files in the same directory
# whose names only differ in casing), the option must be set to YES to properly
# deal with such files in case they appear in the input. For filesystems that
# are not case sensitive the option should be set to NO to properly deal with
# output files written for symbols that only differ in casing, such as for two
# classes, one named CLASS and the other named Class, and to also support
# references to files without having to specify the exact matching casing. On
# Windows (including Cygwin) and macOS, users should typically set this option
# to NO, whereas on Linux or other Unix flavors it should typically be set to
# YES.
# Possible values are: SYSTEM, NO and YES.
# The default value is: SYSTEM.

CASE_SENSE_NAMES       = No

# If the HIDE_UNDOC_NAMESPACES tag is set to YES, Doxygen will hide all
# undocumented namespaces that are normally visible in the namespace hierarchy.
# If set to NO, these namespaces will be included in the various overviews. This
# option has no effect if EXTRACT_ALL is enabled.
# The default value is: YES.

HIDE_UNDOC_NAMESPACES = NO

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to warning and progress messages
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This WARN_NO_PARAMDOC option can be enabled to get warnings for functions that
# are documented, but have no documentation for their parameters or return
# value. If set to NO, Doxygen will only warn about wrong parameter
# documentation, but not about the absence of documentation. If EXTRACT_ALL is
# set to YES then this flag will automatically be disabled. See also
# WARN_IF_INCOMPLETE_DOC
# The default value is: NO.

WARN_NO_PARAMDOC       = YES

# If WARN_IF_UNDOC_ENUM_VAL option is set to YES, Doxygen will warn about
# undocumented enumeration values. If set to NO, Doxygen will accept
# undocumented enumeration values. If EXTRACT_ALL is set to YES then this flag
# will automatically be disabled.
# The default value is: NO.

WARN_IF_UNDOC_ENUM_VAL = YES

# If the WARN_AS_ERROR tag is set to YES then Doxygen will immediately stop when
# a warning is encountered. If the WARN_AS_ERROR tag is set to FAIL_ON_WARNINGS
# then Doxygen will continue running as if WARN_AS_ERROR tag is set to NO, but
# at the end of the Doxygen process Doxygen will return with a non-zero status.
# If the WARN_AS_ERROR tag is set to FAIL_ON_WARNINGS_PRINT then Doxygen behaves
# like FAIL_ON_WARNINGS but in case no WARN_LOGFILE is defined Doxygen will not
# write the warning messages in between other messages but write them at the end
# of a run, in case a WARN_LOGFILE is defined the warning messages will be
# besides being in the defined file also be shown at the end of a run, unless
# the WARN_LOGFILE is defined as - i.e. standard output (stdout) in that case
# the behavior will remain as with the setting FAIL_ON_WARNINGS.
# Possible values are: NO, YES, FAIL_ON_WARNINGS and FAIL_ON_WARNINGS_PRINT.
# The default value is: NO.

WARN_AS_ERROR          = YES

# If the WARN_IF_UNDOCUMENTED tag is set to YES then Doxygen will generate
# warnings for undocumented members. If EXTRACT_ALL is set to YES then this flag
# will automatically be disabled.
# The default value is: YES.

WARN_IF_UNDOCUMENTED   = NO

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces. See also FILE_PATTERNS and EXTENSION_MAPPING
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

INPUT = .

# The RECURSIVE tag can be used to specify whether or not subdirectories should
# be searched for input files as well.
# The default value is: NO.

RECURSIVE = YES

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the
# FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard patterns (like *.cpp and
# *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories.
#
# Note that for custom extensions or not directly supported extensions you also
# need to set EXTENSION_MAPPING for the extension otherwise the files are not
# read by Doxygen.
#
# Note the list of default checked file patterns might differ from the list of
# default file extension mappings.
#
# If left blank the following patterns are tested:*.c, *.cc, *.cxx, *.cxxm,
# *.cpp, *.cppm, *.ccm, *.c++, *.c++m, *.java, *.ii, *.ixx, *.ipp, *.i++, *.inl,
# *.idl, *.ddl, *.odl, *.h, *.hh, *.hxx, *.hpp, *.h++, *.l, *.cs, *.d, *.php,
# *.php4, *.php5, *.phtml, *.inc, *.m, *.markdown, *.md, *.mm, *.dox (to be
# provided as Doxygen C comment), *.py, *.pyw, *.f90, *.f95, *.f03, *.f08,
# *.f18, *.f, *.for, *.vhd, *.vhdl, *.ucf, *.qsf and *.ice.

FILE_PATTERNS          = *.inc \
                         *.f90 \
                         *.md

# The EXCLUDE tag can be used to specify files and/or directories that should be
# excluded from the INPUT source files. This way you can easily exclude a
# subdirectory from a directory tree whose root is specified with the INPUT tag.
#
# Note that relative paths are relative to the directory from which Doxygen is
# run.

EXCLUDE                = docs ford-home.md src/poisson

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the
# EXCLUDE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard patterns to exclude
# certain files from those directories.
#
# Note that the wildcards are matched against the file with absolute path, so to
# exclude all test directories for example use the pattern */test/*

EXCLUDE_PATTERNS = *testing/pFUnit/*.pf *testing/pFUnit/*.F90 *testing/pFUnit/*.inc \
                   *testing/veggies/*.f90 \
                   *testing/test-drive/*.f90 

# The EXCLUDE_SYMLINKS tag can be used to select whether or not files or
# directories that are symbolic links (a Unix file system feature) are excluded
# from the input.
# The default value is: NO.

EXCLUDE_SYMLINKS       = YES

# The IMAGE_PATH tag can be used to specify one or more files or directories
# that contain images that are to be included in the documentation (see the
# \image command).

IMAGE_PATH             = docs/assets

# The FILTER_PATTERNS tag can be used to specify filters on a per file pattern
# basis. Doxygen will compare the file name with each pattern and apply the
# filter if there is a match. The filters are a list of the form: pattern=filter
# (like *.cpp=my_cpp_filter). See INPUT_FILTER for further information on how
# filters are used. If the FILTER_PATTERNS tag is empty or if none of the
# patterns match the file name, INPUT_FILTER is applied.
#
# Note that for custom extensions or not directly supported extensions you also
# need to set EXTENSION_MAPPING for the extension otherwise the files are not
# properly processed by Doxygen.

# Remove `---` sections from the top of .md files before processing
FILTER_PATTERNS = *.md=./documentation/doxygen/strip_triple_dash_sections.py

# If the USE_MDFILE_AS_MAINPAGE tag refers to the name of a markdown file that
# is part of the input, its contents will be placed on the main page
# (index.html). This can be useful if you have a project on for instance GitHub
# and want to reuse the introduction page also for the Doxygen output.

USE_MDFILE_AS_MAINPAGE = doxygen-home.md

# If the IMPLICIT_DIR_DOCS tag is set to YES, any README.md file found in sub-
# directories of the project's root, is used as the documentation for that sub-
# directory, except when the README.md starts with a \dir, \page or \mainpage
# command. If set to NO, the README.md file needs to start with an explicit \dir
# command in order to be used as directory documentation.
# The default value is: YES.

IMPLICIT_DIR_DOCS      = NO

# The Fortran standard specifies that for fixed formatted Fortran code all
# characters from position 72 are to be considered as comment. A common
# extension is to allow longer lines before the automatic comment starts. The
# setting FORTRAN_COMMENT_AFTER will also make it possible that longer lines can
# be processed before the automatic comment starts.
# Minimum value: 7, maximum value: 10000, default value: 72.

FORTRAN_COMMENT_AFTER  = 140

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to source browsing
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the SOURCE_BROWSER tag is set to YES then a list of source files will be
# generated. Documented entities will be cross-referenced with these sources.
#
# Note: To get rid of all source code in the generated output, make sure that
# also VERBATIM_HEADERS is set to NO.
# The default value is: NO.

SOURCE_BROWSER         = YES

# Setting the INLINE_SOURCES tag to YES will include the body of functions,
# multi-line macros, enums or list initialized variables directly into the
# documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

INLINE_SOURCES         = YES

# Setting the STRIP_CODE_COMMENTS tag to YES will instruct Doxygen to hide any
# special comment blocks from generated source code fragments. Normal C, C++ and
# Fortran comments will always remain visible.
# The default value is: YES.

STRIP_CODE_COMMENTS    = NO

# If the REFERENCED_BY_RELATION tag is set to YES then for each documented
# entity all documented functions referencing it will be listed.
# The default value is: NO.

REFERENCED_BY_RELATION = YES

# If the REFERENCES_RELATION tag is set to YES then for each documented function
# all documented entities called/used by that function will be listed.
# The default value is: NO.

REFERENCES_RELATION    = YES

# If the REFERENCES_LINK_SOURCE tag is set to YES and SOURCE_BROWSER tag is set
# to YES then the hyperlinks from functions in REFERENCES_RELATION and
# REFERENCED_BY_RELATION lists will link to the source code. Otherwise they will
# link to the documentation.
# The default value is: YES.

REFERENCES_LINK_SOURCE = YES

# If SOURCE_TOOLTIPS is enabled (the default) then hovering a hyperlink in the
# source code will show a tooltip with additional information such as prototype,
# brief description and links to the definition and documentation. Since this
# will make the HTML file larger and loading of large files a bit slower, you
# can opt to disable this feature.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag SOURCE_BROWSER is set to YES.

SOURCE_TOOLTIPS        = YES

# If the VERBATIM_HEADERS tag is set the YES then Doxygen will generate a
# verbatim copy of the header file for each class for which an include is
# specified. Set to NO to disable this.
# See also: Section \class.
# The default value is: YES.

VERBATIM_HEADERS       = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the alphabetical class index
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the ALPHABETICAL_INDEX tag is set to YES, an alphabetical index of all
# compounds will be generated. Enable this if the project contains a lot of
# classes, structs, unions or interfaces.
# The default value is: YES.

ALPHABETICAL_INDEX     = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the HTML output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_HTML tag is set to YES, Doxygen will generate HTML output
# The default value is: YES.

GENERATE_HTML          = YES

# The HTML_OUTPUT tag is used to specify where the HTML docs will be put. If a
# relative path is entered the value of OUTPUT_DIRECTORY will be put in front of
# it.
# The default directory is: html.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_OUTPUT            = "html"


#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the LaTeX output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES, Doxygen will generate LaTeX output.
# The default value is: YES.

GENERATE_LATEX         = NO


#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the preprocessor
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
